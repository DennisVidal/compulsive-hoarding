# Serious Game: Compulsive Hoarding
 
This is a VR serious game that can potentially be used in the treatment of various hoarding disorders. It is the result of a collaboration between seven students and multiple psychologists with the goal to create a game that psychologists can use as a tool to help their patients. The goal of the game is to pick up items and throw them away. Although that sounds simple to most, people with some form of compulsive hoarding can have immense problems with letting go of certain items. The overall gameplay loop allows patients to slowly get used to throwing objects away, while their psychologist instructs and monitors them. The usage of VR offers an efficient, safe and, most importantly, immersive way of allowing psychologists to treat their patients without any real required setup or effort.
